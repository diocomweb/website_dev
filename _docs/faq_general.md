### What is Diode?

Diode is an integrated Blockchain implementation of the Web3, the server-less internet and the decentralized web, targeted primarily at enabling IoT devices. It was designed to address the security and infrastructure needs of device-driven connected applications.

### Where did the name "Diode" come from?

We went back and forth with a ton of different potential names. We wanted the name of the technology and network etc… to connote something that really small things could interact with, and something that was secure. We wanted it to have some sort of face value to both Blockchain and IoT folks. It was a small electrical component that is fundamental to all electrical systems, and the use of the letters in the word kind of made a acronym for “Distributed Interent Of DEvices”

With the Diode tech, now all sorts of apps/devices/systems can interact directly with a public blockchain - cell phones, laptops, Raspberry Pis, Arduinos, etc… can all interact as part of a decentralized Web3 ecosystem.


### What is a fleet contract?

A fleet contract is a smart contract that stores the identidies of clients (public keys) that have permissions to communicate. What is a smart contract? When we talk about smart contracts, we are not referring to legally binding contracts. A fleet contract is a smart contract; a smart contract is essentailly a set of instructions written in computer code that is stored on a blockchain.

A smart contract is a computer program, and smart contracts store data. The logic of smart contract is enforced by the full nodes involved; the data is kept by the full nodes. So in our context, this means that the full nodes running on Diode blockchain are storing all the data.

### What does a Diode's fleet contract do?
What a Diode’s fleet contract does is it manages the whitelist of idendities (public keys) of clients who can communicate with each other. It provides a number of functions to facilitate secure communications, including client registration, client deregistration, protected or private connections, and other functions.

### Is Diode something similar to IPFS?

IPFS is about static file storage - it does that really well. Diode is more of a streaming network - the Diode network doesn’t store information, it makes it available. One of the great things that Diode brings that we believe is unique is the ability for distributing dynamic content. One of our first proof of concepts was a Raspberry Pi streaming real-time video peer-to-peer over the Diode network with no centralized components. The Pi did the work to create the content and “source” the video, but the network handled the routing, permissions, and distribution.

IPFS and Diode are both needed for a decentralized web3. IPFS is a distributed file system that allows storing static content, while Diode network enables secure real-time end2end encrypted communication. What makes Diode unique is there are lots of interesting things you can do with Diode. In addition to files, Diode allows you to do live video streaming, chat applications, office applications where users get to modify their contents,... are some of the good examples illustrating real-time data streams possible applications.


### What can I do with Diode?

Diode is a new decentralized Internet for connected devices, also known as the Web 3. We are building upon the Web3 movement. Currently we are looking at serving a number of groups of users: makers, corporates, consumers, independent journalists/free speech activists.

As a Maker, you will be able to create server-less IoT devices. Your devices are securely reachable to you and your friends from anywhere in the world even if they are behind NATs or firewalls.

As a Corporate, you can create e2e secure device connections which are resistant to attacks to the three pillars of the Web1/2: DNS, PKI, BGP. Attackers, including government actors, will have no chance to launch man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on your IoT rollout.

As a Consumer, you can get full transparency on how your IoT devices are controlled and protect your privacy. There are no hidden server administrators anymore who have access to all your data.

As an Independent Journalist or a Free Speech Activist, you can broadcast your video streams through the Web3 uninterruptible to your audience no matter what country on the planet.


### What are some of the interesting applications that can be created on Diode?

You can build all kinds of Web3 applications on Diode. Here are some examples:

*   Decentralized IoT services such as video cameras that can stream or broadcast video data without the need for a central server.
*   Server-less IoT fleets that would not have any administrators that can spy on the IoT devices, but they would only be managed by transparent and auditable smart contracts.
*   Decentralized messaging apps that can send messages, data and tokens, and can’t be stopped.
*   Uncensorable websites that live in the Diode Network and are always reachable from everywhere.
*   Decentralized Friend to Friend File sharing services
*   Secure Network bridges and Blockchain controlled VPN, ([Blockchain Defined Networks BDN](https://diode.io/distributed-infrastructure/from-software-defined-networking-to-blockchain-defined-networking-19142/))


### There are several existing tools already pretty available to developers, helping them achieve the task of “demoing websites without deploying,” is it really necessary to do it with blockchain technology?

It is certainly not necessary, but there are advantages that we think will make this specific use case more attractive than the ones on the market today. Three of the immediate feature adds vs. other solutions are: you can publish content to a globally unique “domain” name of your choice, it's free, and if you want to limit access to just a few viewers, you can do that regardless of the IP they are on.

Because the tech is fully decentralized, it also has benefits for privacy.  If a person wanted to publish a website - as a dev tool for localhost development, or as a long term site - they can do so with the only information about the website (other than its content) being the Diode address (just like an ETH public address).  No ICANN registration, personal details, etc…. The fact that Web3/decentralized tech can stand toe-to-toe now with centralized tech in this, and other use cases, is a first. We wanted to prove this, and doing this as a proof-of-concept was so simple! The barrier to creating decentralized apps of this type is lower (in many ways) than centralized methods, and we believe will be much cheaper over time.


### How would you persuade software engineers and business leaders to assess the potential of Diode blockchain for their businesses?

The persuasion of software engineers and business leaders will be a road we have to travel. The word “blockchain”, frankly speaking, scares some people from industry. However, there are a growing number of developers who are not blockchain developers, but who are interested in blockchain. Because we can support the tech these people are used to working with blockchain, we believe these people will be early adopters and be one of the paths to mainstream adoption. We're very excited about bringing the blockchain and non-blockchain development worlds together - we have a way to go in terms of UX, but the fundamentals are there and will get stronger over time.


### What is your biggest unique proposition that puts you ahead of the competition?

The Diode Network is an implementation of a truly decentralized internet replacement. It builds on top of Ethereum as base technology but melds BlockQuick and Swarm like capabilities natively into the chain. 

*   Diode is the only Blockchain with super-light clients that:
    *   Works in Browsers
    *   Works on Mobile
    *   Works on Embedded Devices (RaspberryPi, Arduino, ESP32...)
*   Diode has an incentive model for Data traffic built-in



### How are we different from other existing blockchain protocols in the Web3 ecosystem?

We are seeing a number of players in the ecosystem doing some great work developing frameworks to build blockchains. But Diode has a different approach. Diode is a blockchain which empowers developers to build data applications on top and build a better Internet. If you want to compare Diode with other existing projects, the closest would be dat-protocol, Ethereum-Swarm, and IPFS.

The difference is, for instance, IPFS only works with pre-hashed files, so live-streaming and web conferencing for example, would not work. Diode, on the other hand, is a general network layer. It is designed to work for all kind of network applications.


### What are some of the possible applications for small-scale agriculture projects?

There are lots of things you can do with agriculture. The most straightforward application would be monitoring connected devices over the Diode Network. So, if you setup greenhouse monitoring on your Pi, then you can use the Diode Network to monitor and control your device securely anywhere in the world. You can even use the Diode gateway at "yourname" .diode.link to showcase your solution to everybody, without needing a server.


### Would it be something that runs on the router or on the person's computer in the future?

Absolutely, it could be routers in the future. In fact, that is one of our use cases that we are currently developing.


### How do I get started with Diode Chain?

As a Miner / Service Provider:
NOTE: Currently we are still working on fundamental changes regularly and would often restart the test network from scratch -- If you run a node, you will have to do the same or risk living on your own fork net.

To mine in the test network you can checkout the mining software from [https://github.com/diodechain/diode_server_ex](https://github.com/diodechain/diode_server_ex). Put it up on your server and start.

As a Maker with an embedded project:
We are currently working on a README to get started. Come October onboarding and getting your devices into the Web3 should be straight forward on our test network.

As a Code Contributor:
Check out our source code on Github [https://github.com/diodechain](https://github.com/diodechain). There is tons to do both in research and development. We’re working on publishing a list of tickets and tasks in the meantime. Contact us via Telegram group @diode_chain if you’re curious to help.


### How can Diode compete with IOTA?

IOTA is non-functional for IoT use cases apart from Demos and prototypes. It has at least two big problems:

1. IOTA doesn’t have smart contracts. This limits use cases to 0.1% of what is possible.
2. IOTA doesn’t run on 99% of IoT devices (runs only on luxury Cars with “real computers inside”)
    1. Minimal client hardware requirements for an IOTA node:
        1. 4+ GB of RAM
        2. 8+ GB of Storage
        3. Java 1.8.0_151 or higher.
    2. Light nodes do not exist -- They market a centralized RPC client as light node.

And one new problem: The old algorithm didn’t scale decentralized; it was centralized. IOTA is now in the middle of changing the core Consensus to “Coordicide”. This will mean any production deployments will have to wait until at least 2022.
